# Crop Recommendation Using Soil Prediction
By predicting the soil type we can suggest the crops that are suitable for the particular soil which will enhance the yield.

## Model
I have used CNN model to train the dataset of soils. 

### CNN Algorithm
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm specifically designed for image processing and recognition tasks. Compared to alternative classification models, CNNs require less preprocessing as they can automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw input images.
